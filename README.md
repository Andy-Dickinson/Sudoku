# Sudoku in C

To compile the program, open a terminal window and navigate to the directory where sudoku is located.

Delete any executable file in the directory.
Delete any object file in the directory.

Either run the C makefile with parameter "all" which will compile and run the sudoku program.
e.g. "make all" (if your call to c make is "make")

Or compile with GCC running the following commands:
	gcc sudoku.c user_interface.c generate_board.c -o sudoku
followed by:
	.\sudoku.exe
